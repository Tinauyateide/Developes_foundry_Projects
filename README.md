## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tinauyateide/Developes_foundry_Projects.git
   cd Developes_foundry_Projects
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run notebooks**
   - Open JupyterLab or VS Code and run the notebooks in `first_ml_assingment/` and `second_ml_project/`.

## Contents
- `first_ml_assingment/house_price_prediction.ipynb`: House price prediction notebook with EDA, feature engineering, model training, and diagnostics.
- `second_ml_project/taxi_prediction.ipynb`: Taxi fare prediction notebook with EDA and modeling.
- `models/`: Saved preprocessing pipeline and best model artifacts.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for reproducibility.
- `.gitignore`: Excludes unnecessary files from version control.

## Example: Load and Predict
See `models/README.md` for details on loading the preprocessor and model artifacts.
